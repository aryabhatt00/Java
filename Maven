Understanding Maven and Dependency Management in Java
ðŸ”¹ Why Dependency Management is Important?
When sharing a project, others need to download the exact versions of required JAR files. This process can be complex, but Maven simplifies it by managing dependencies automatically.

ðŸ”¹ Maven as a Solution

Maven helps manage standard dependencies efficiently.
Dependencies can be downloaded from Maven Repository.
It provides archetypes, which act as templating tools for project structures.
Configuration is done in pom.xml (Project Object Model).
ðŸ”¹ Key Concept: GAV (GroupID, ArtifactID, VersionID)
Every library in Maven follows:
âœ… GroupID â€“ A unique package identifier.
âœ… ArtifactID â€“ The name of the project/library.
âœ… VersionID â€“ The specific version of the library.

ðŸ”¹ Including Dependencies in pom.xml
All required dependencies must be enclosed within:

xml
Copy
Edit
<dependencies>
   <!-- Add dependencies here -->
</dependencies>
ðŸ”¹ Effective POM / Super POM
Maven has a Super POM, which acts as a parent to all pom.xml files, providing default configurations.

ðŸ“Œ Maven streamlines project setup and dependency management, making Java development more efficient!
